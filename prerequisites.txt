1. X11 installed
    2.1 Download and install http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/

2. SDL v1.2
    2.1 Download framework from https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
    2.2 Copy to /Library/Frameworks


This should be it for now but I might have overseen something. Please let me know.

Optional for 32 bit support:

1. Libpng 1.5 is needed. I have included the compiled libs for now so no need to do anything. These only include 64 bit at the moment.
   If needed one can compile 32 bit instead or both
