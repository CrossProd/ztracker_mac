# zTracker for macOS / OS X


A port of cmicali's zTracker (originally available for Windows only) - port started by CrossProd but then I guess it never finished.

* https://github.com/cmicali/ztracker

cmicali described his zTracker like this:
**zTracker is a win32 only MIDI tracker/sequencer modeled after Impulse Tracker.
The project is currently closed but the source is archived here.**
